Aurelia Types Installer (ati) is a small command line utility for developers using [Aurelia](https://github.com/Aurelia) with [jspm](//jspm.io/) and [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript).

ati parses jspm configuration locates Aurelia package dependencies and installs their exact corresponding `.d.ts` declarations as proper
anonymous external modules into a location of your choosing. As it install declarations, it generates TypeScript path configuratoin and 
writes it to a file named `tsconfig.paths.json` by default. If you are using typescript@2.1.0-dev you can import this file into your `tsconfig.json`

ati works best when installed as a local `"devDependency"` and is designed to be run as part of your build process.

Usage:

```bash
~/GitHub/Apps/Demos> ati install
```
runs with optimized default config that looks for local `jspm.config.js` and `tsconfig.json` files and installs declarations dependencies 
into versioned subfolders of in a `types` directory.

```bash
~/GitHub/Apps/Demos> ati install --projectDir C:\Users\Robert\Source\bobs-app
```
runs relative to the specified directory

```bash
~/GitHub/Apps/Demos> ati install --dest ./type-declarations
```
specifies the directory where `.d.ts` files will be installed. This is used to customize generation of `tsconfig.paths.json`

```bash
~/GitHub/Apps/Demos> ati install --framework aurelia
```
specifies the name or prefix of the framework to install declaration files. Currently aurelia is the defualt value and support for other dependencies is experimental.

When run it produces the following output
Files:
`tsconfig.paths.json`
```JSON
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "aurelia-framework": [
        "types/aurelia-framework@x.y.z/index"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
Directories:
`types` default `.d.ts` installation dir
external, non-ambiant, module files containing the type declarations for all aurelia jspm dependencies.
